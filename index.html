        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Vyom Sharma, a postgraduate student in Materials Science at the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT), DRDO. My research focuses on nanomaterials, particularly the synthesis and application of Ce-Fe doped NiO nanoparticles for water remediation. I completed my B.Sc. in Physical Sciences with Chemistry from Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, University of Delhi, where I worked on multiple research projects, including nanomaterials and the nutritional analysis of fruit and vegetable juices.

Beyond research, I have actively contributed as a student coordinator, organizing workshops, conferences, and symposiums. I have also presented my work at international conferences and served as a resource person for scientific workshops. My technical expertise includes computational tools like OriginPro, PowderX, FullProf Suite, LaTeX, and Mathematica, along with hands-on experience in X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and electron microscopy.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have been a private tutor since 2021, helping students excel in mathematics and science. My passion for materials science, research, and academic engagement drives me to explore innovative solutions for real-worldÂ challenges.</p>
